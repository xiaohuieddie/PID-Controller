    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x. See [this PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Project/pull/3) for more details.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Rubric Points
### Describe the effect each of the P, I, D components had in your implementation.

 - **P component:** the P, or "proportional", component had the most directly observable effect on the car’s behaviour. It causes the car to steer proportional (and opposite) to the car’s distance from the lane center(CTE) - if the car is far to the right it steers hard to the left, if it’s slightly to the left it steers slightly to the right.
 - **D component:** It’s the differential component of the controller which helps to take temporal derivative of error. This means when the car turned enough to reduce the error, it will help not to overshoot through the x axis. In other words, the D, or "differential", component counteracts the P component’s tendency to ring and overshoot the center line. A properly tuned D parameter will cause the car to approach the center line smoothly without ringing.
 - **I component**: It’s the integral or sum of error to deal with systematic biases. In other words, the I, or "integral", component counteracts a bias in the CTE which prevents the P-D controller from reaching the center line. This bias can take several forms, such as a steering drift , but I believe that in this particular implementation the I component particularly serves to reduce the CTE around curves.

### Describe how the final hyperparameters were chosen.

 - **Finding initial value for Kp, Ki, Kd :** The intial value for Kp, Ki, Kd selected using trail and error method. It is a simple method of PID controller tuning. In this method, first we have to set Ki and Kd values to zero and increase proportional term (Kp) until system reaches to oscillating behaviour. Then Kd was tuned to reduced oscillation and then Ki to reduce steady-state error.
 - **Twiddle:** Parameter optimisation was done manually and using the Twiddle algorithm. I followed the pseudocode from the class and translated it to C++ line by line making sure I initialized the coefficients within reasonable ranges. Twiddle contributed to the further tweaking of the coefficients. The optimized PID values I found is {0.2, 0.00031, 3.0}.
